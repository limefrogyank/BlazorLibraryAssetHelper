# To Use

1.  Install VSIX from VS extensions.
2.  Open any Blazor project.
3.  Go to View->Other Windows->Blazor Library Asset Helper
4.  If multiple projects, select which project to choose assets for at the top of the window.
5.  Choose JS and CSS files you want to include.  Order them using the Up and Down buttons.
6.  Click Generate HTML button and copy/paste the contents to your html file.
7.  Current selections and order will be saved in a file called assetPrefs.xml.
